# Our aim is to find the best nodes to activate in order to maximize the social influence once a budget is given. For a first algorithm, we can try to code a Greedy Algorithm.
# Assumptions :
# All the nodes have the same budget activation
# The activation probabilities are known.
# The budget is constant over experiences.
