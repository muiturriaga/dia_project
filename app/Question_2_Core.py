# Our aim is to find the best nodes to activate in order to maximize the social influence once a budget is given. For a first algorithm, we can try to code a Greedy Algorithm.

# Assumptions :
# All the nodes have the same budget activation
# The activation probabilities are known.
# The budget is constant over experiences.
# A node can be activated one time in a episode.
# A node has multiple sharing, that means it can activate many nodes.
# Graph directed.
# Reward : A nodes activated.
